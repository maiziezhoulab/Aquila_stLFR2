## :octopus: Aquila_stLFR

#### v1.2.10 -- The first version; used for aquila_stLFR paper
#### v1.2.11 -- Updated on 09/20/2019; update Aquila_stLFR to remove intermediate local assembly files after generating contigs for each chromosome, since too many of them could cause a burden for the disk storage, especially when using Aquila_stLFR to perform assembly for multiple samples.
